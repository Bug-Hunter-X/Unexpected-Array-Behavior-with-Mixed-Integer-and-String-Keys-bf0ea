In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["key1"] = "value1";
$myArray[1] = "value2";

echo $myArray[0]; // Notice the access to index 0
?>
```

While seemingly straightforward, accessing `$myArray[0]` might not yield the expected result. PHP's loose typing allows for both string and integer keys in arrays.  Here, `$myArray` has both a string key ("key1") and an integer key (1).  Accessing via an integer index (0) might return an empty string, `NULL`, or produce a warning/notice, depending on the PHP version and error reporting level. This is because PHP doesn't automatically assign consecutive integer keys in such cases. The behavior is not consistent and depends on the PHP internal array handling. This often leads to unexpected results and can be especially challenging to debug because the error might not be immediately apparent.
