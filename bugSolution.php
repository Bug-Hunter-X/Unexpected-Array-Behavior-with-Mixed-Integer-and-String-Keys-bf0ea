The solution involves being explicit with array access. Avoid relying on implicit integer key assignments when string keys are also present.  Always use the exact key you intend to access.  If you need sequential numerical indexing, use an approach that explicitly manages those indices:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["key1"] = "value1";
$myArray[1] = "value2";

// Access using string and integer keys directly
echo $myArray["key1"]; // Outputs: value1
echo $myArray[1];     // Outputs: value2

// If you need sequential numeric access, use a different data structure or explicitly manage indices:
$myArray2 = [];
$myArray2[] = "value3";
$myArray2[] = "value4";
echo $myArray2[0];   // Outputs: value3
echo $myArray2[1];   // Outputs: value4
?>
```

By explicitly specifying keys, you remove ambiguity and ensure predictable behavior, preventing unexpected output or errors.
