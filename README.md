# PHP Array Key Surprise

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic aspect of PHP's array handling when mixing string and integer keys. Accessing array elements using integer indices might not behave as expected when the array also contains string keys.

The `bug.php` file showcases the issue. The `bugSolution.php` provides a solution demonstrating a safer way to handle arrays and access elements.
